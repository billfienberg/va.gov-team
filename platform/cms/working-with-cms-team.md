### When to check-in/collaborate with CMS team <a id="whentorequest"></a>

CMS support is available anytime you have questions or want to collaborate on your work, so don't hesitate to reach out at any time.

#### For product designers and managers

**At project kick-off**

* If your project involves non-authenticated \(public\) content, it is helpful to get a high level overview of the CMS and its products. 
* Schedule a 30 minute [VA.gov CMS intro](working-with-cms-team.md#vagov-intro) by [sending an email to VACMSSupport@va.gov](mailto:VACMSSupport@va.gov?subject=Scheduling+a+VA.gov+intro>) \(or opening an issue?\). 

**During Discovery**

* If your product's content may be managed within the CMS, schedule a [CMS scoping exercise](cms-scoping-exercise.md), around the same time as the [design intent review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#design-intent-check-in). 

**During Design**

* If your product involves additions to the content model and/or the editorial experience, please involve \(who?\) from the CMS team on a regular basis.  

**During Development**

**Orientation**

**During Development**
