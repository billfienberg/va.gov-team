# UX writing discovery

Mapping **language and vocabularies** to **personas**, **journeys**, and **workflows** that are validated by **research** and documented and intentegrated into CMS **governance** and **design patterns**.

## Language audits

_Looking at legacy research and the current CMS to understand what language patterns currently exist._

**Helps us understand**

* What kind of feedback have we already received from cms users? What workflows are difficult?
* What is the baseline / “before” picture of language context in the cms and how is it impacting usability?

**Vocabularies**

* Technical: Drupal
* Technical: web
* plain language
* org familiar
* abstract technical

**Voice and tone**

* point of view \(first, second, third person\)
* directive \(authoritative\)
* directive \(helpful\)

**Grammar**

* parallel structure

## User research

_What language do CMS users employ to describe their own work?_

* _What kind of context do users need so they can understand language they encounter in the CMS, without relying on external support?_
* _What words are familiar or difficult for each user?_

**Possible methods**

* Highligher testing \(_What words make users feel more or less confident?_\)
* Card sorts \(_Terms I understand fully/ terms I'm not sure about / terms I don't understand_\)
* Log analysis \(_What language are users employing to describe their work and problems with the CMS?_\)
* CMS training observation \(_what kinds of help/feedback are users requesting?_\)

## Personas, journey mapping, workflows

_Understanding how vocabularies map to different personas and Drupal user roles, and how that guides the CMS team's communication with users._

## Back end style guide

_What kinds of rules do we need to establish or further define to ensure consistency?_
