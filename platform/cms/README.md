# Content Management System

VA.gov's content management system provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

### A guide to CMS Documentation

Documentation about the CMS lives in various places

* The CMS itself houses [CMS user guides](https://prod.cms.va.gov/documentation) \(VA network access required, and CMS login required, for now\). 
* The [va.gov-cms repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms) contains docs for developers working on the CMS codebase.
* [The directory containing this README](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms) contains documentation needed by other VA.gov teams, such as Platform \(VSP\) or product \(VSA\) teams. Read more about [using the va.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/repo-guidelines.md#naming-guidelines).
* [Confluence](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/179765342/2020-2021) houses private documentaiton used by the team, including our scrum notes, demos, team calendars, and ship reports. We may stop using Confluence at some point, and replace it with the two documentation homes mentioned below.
* [Shared Drive in Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA) is used for WIP documentation and deliverables \(such as Research Plan\), and other forms collaboration. Also, our defacto home for spreadsheets. Google products are not available on the VA network and the Drive should not be used for any 
* [va.gov-team-sensitive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive) houses sensitive documentation that should be accessible to certain VA teams, but not made public. This includes [incident reports/post-mortems](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/Postmortems) for all teams, and [information specific to the CMS application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/platform/cms) such as login/SSO or other sensitive topics.

* [va.gov-cms-team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms-team) may house private team documentation. It may replace the CMS team's current use of Confluence.
