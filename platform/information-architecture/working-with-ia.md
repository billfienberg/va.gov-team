# Working with IA - Rules of Engagement \(ROE\)

This document will help all teams working on VA.gov understand when you should engage IA resources for collaboration and support. All teams building on the Veteran Services Platform should follow VA.gov IA best practices and guidelines and work with an IA resource to ensure all content is easily findable and we maintain a consistent navigation experience across the site.

## What does IA do? <a id="whatdoesIAdo"></a>

> _”Information Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content…The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.“_ - Usability.gov

**There are 2 primary focus areas of IA support on VSP** 1. **Site Structure** = The overall structure and organization of all content and tools on VA.gov. The structure impacts content design, page flow, URLs, labeling and SEO. We also help ensure proper redirects and/or vanity URLs are in place if needed.

1. **Navigation Design** = The labeling and experience of all navigation elements and the identification of primary entry points and key cross-linking opportunities.  This includes top and left navigation components, home and hub page links, the breadcrumb, footer links, related link components, inline content links, etc.  

**When should you think about IA?**

* Launching a new content page\(s\) on VA.gov
* Launching a new tool on VA.gov
* Rewriting content and need to split or merge existing pages
* Looking to improve findability of an existing page or tool
* Taking down a content page and/or tool
* Changing the UX of global navigational elements \(i.e. top nav, left nav, breadcrumbs\)

## When to check-in/collaborate with IA <a id="whentorequest"></a>

IA support is available anytime you have questions or want to collaborate on your work, so don't hesitate to reach out at any time. Here are some key times in your work, where collaborating with IA can be helpful. Keeping us up to speed on your work will reduce the time needed for an IA review and reduce the risk of needing to do rework.

**At project kick-off**

* It is beneficial to engage IA resources as early as possible in your work so we can gather background information, understand scope and timing, and determine how to work together through your project. Involving an IA resource earlier in your project will help avoid structural changes down the line. 

**During Discovery**

* We can provide input and feedback on user research approach, review discussion guides and prototypes for navigation design and labeling, and look at how findability of your content/tool can be included as part of your research. 
* If research is highly focused on findability, flow and navigation, we ask that you please include us in the sessions as well.  
* Include us in research readouts so we can evolve your appropriately based on your findings.

**During Design**

* We will provide feedback on page flow and navigational elements of designs and prototypes
* IA and writing need to work together, and as content evolves, it can impact the IA.  Content elements are also used to determine pages names/URLs. 
* If your project includes multiple content pages or complex content, we ask that you work with us during the writing process.  We will provide feedback on how structuring content impacts IA. 

**During Development**

* We will approve final URLs and navigation labels and placement \(in collaboration with content\), as well as coordinate redirect implmentation, and help with any other documentation for your development team.  

## What is an IA review? <a id="iareview"></a>

An IA review is part the process when working on the platform to ensure a consistent structure and experience is maintained for our users regardless of the number of people and teams building user experiences on VA.gov.

**Here are the key things evaluated in an IA review** 1. IA Structure - Where does the tool/content live within the overall structure of the site 2. URLs and page breadcrumbs - Does the URL and breadcrumb follow the correct IA and standards used across the site? 3. Primary entry points and high level user flow - What are the primary ways users will access the content/tool and where are they linked to within and after? 4. Navigational components - What changes are needed to global nav components \(i.e. top nav, header, left nav, etc\) 5. Crosslinking opportunities - Are there opportunities to reference this content/tool in secondary placements across the site? 6. Redirects/canonical - Is there legacy or duplicative content that needs to be handled?
