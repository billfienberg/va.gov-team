# Requesting Redirects

This process should be used if you have a URL \(or multiple URLs\) that needs to be redirected.

All redirects will be routed through Content and IA team for validation and then assigned to the appropriate technical team for implementation.

**Redirects must be requested** _**at least**_ **2 weeks in advance to ensure they are properly vetted and an implementation approach can be identified. However, some redirects may take longer to implement \(weeks to months\), so it is highly encouraged that requests are submitted as soon as you are aware that you will need one.**

## Responsibility of requesting team

* Clearly indicate the date the redirects should be live and notify everyone on the ticket if that date changes
* Communicate the redirects to the appropriate stakeholders \(both VA and internal\)
* Ensure the destination pages will be live at the time of the redirect deploy and that they have the correct URL
* Readily answer any questions during the vetting and implementation process
* Validate redirect in production and close the ticket

## Responsibility of Content and IA team

* Ensure that the the destination URLs are accurate based on agreed IA decisions
* Ensure that all known legacy URLs are accounted for
* Validate if there are any existing redirects that need to be updated
* Ensure redirect is properly documented in IA documentation
* Assign to proper implementation team

## Responsibility of implementation team

* Size and schedule the request based on the requested launch date
* Communicate any technical concerns to everyone on the ticket
* Communicate any timing concerns to everyone on the ticket
* Communicate when redirect has been deployed so teams can validate

## Process

1. Create an issue using the "Redirect Request" template **at least 2 weeks prior to desired launch date**
2. Title the issue "Redirect Request: \[name of page/description of pages\]"
3. Include the date redirects need to be implemented by
4. Include background and reason for redirect request
5. Document the current URL and where the URL should be redirected to.
6. Content and IA team will vet the request and assign to implementation team.
7. Implementation team will implement redirects and notified everyone on issue once deployed.
8. Requesting team will validate in production and close issue.
