## Additional Notes/Recommendations

## Background & Meeting Notes

**Kick-off - 3/17/2020**

* This is an MVP effort based on the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act passed in 2018
* VEO engaged DEPO
* Many different benefits create financial relationships with VA and can create Veteran debt - i.e. VA makes education payment to Veteran but Veteran does not complete credit they were paid for so they need to pay VA back. 
* VA Central Debt Management Center "DMC" - manages all of these debts
* There are different types of debt letters \(possibly 50ish\) - new debt, delinquent, 3rd notice, etc - each business line might have a variation of those types
* Only a small subset of letter types have been digitized and will be part of this work effort \(they are part of eFolder\)
* Solution ideas from team: static content page for digital management of debt, notifications of new debt letters, online viewing of letters, updated content of letters - all focused on MVP subset of letters initially
* there is an office page [https://www.va.gov/debtman/](https://www.va.gov/debtman/)
* There is pay.gov and pay.va.gov

Thoughts/Questions:

* Even though only a few are digitized, will there be an effort to create standardized categorizations/taxonomy of all the letters in prep or as part of this work?
* How does this integrate with Profile?
