# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** Health Care Products/VAOS

**Product/Featue:** VA Online Scheduling

**Background/Context:** Redesign of existing tool for online scheduling of VA appointments. Some appointments can be scheduled online and some clinics only allow you to "request" an appointment. Access/ability to schedule/request varies by clinic.

**Review Date:** 11/7/2019

**IA Review Issue:** [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3152](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3152)

## IA and URL

**Structure:**  
_Description of IA or link to site map documentation_

* New tool will live as a child to the existing static page

**URLs:** _Final URLs to be used_

Unauthenticated Static Page

* Existing static page will be used as entry point to new tool, no IA or URL changes will be made to the page at this time
* URL: No change \([https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)\)
* Breadcrumb: No change \(Home &gt; Health care &gt; Schedule and view appointments\)

Tool:

* initial URL: [https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/)
* Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/introduction/

Added 2/28/2020 \(@mnorthuis\)

* Breadcrumb: Home &gt; Health care &gt; Schedule and view appointments &gt; Your appointments
  * The last component of the breadcrumb should be similar to the H1 of the page, work with your writer to finalize

## Navigation/Entry Points

**Primary** _The primary entry points and changes to global navigation_

* No changes to entry points are needed.  The existing static page content will be updated to direct users to the new tool. 

**Crosslinking** _Recommendations for potential cross-linking opportunities. This can be reviewed and modified/added to by the working team._

* No additional crosslinking recommendations at this time. 

## Redirects/Canonical

_Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed. This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only._

* None at this time.

## Additional Notes/Recommendations

* Work with content/writing team to determine how to best represent "schedule" versus "request" functionality - need to determine whether these labels have an impact on user expectations.
* If the team chooses to change the static page URL \(i.e. change "schedule" to "request"\), a redirect will need to be implemented from old to new URL
