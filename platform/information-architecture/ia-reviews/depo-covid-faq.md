# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** DEPO

**Product/Featue:** Coronavirus COVID-19 FAQ page

**Background/Context:** Looking to provide a page that includes FAQ content that is very Veteran focused to help alleviate the call center volume.

**Review Date:** 3/17/2020

**IA Review Issue:** n/a

## IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs 

_Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements._ 

**Approach:**

* Single static supporting content page that will be linked to from primary Coronavirus pages and communications
* Will live off root level as temporary page

| Page | URL | Breadcrumb |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FAQ page - new | www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions | Home &gt; Coronavirus FAQ: What Veterans need to know |

**General Details**

## Navigation Changes and Entry and Exit Points 

_The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities_

| Priority | Placement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High | The VA.gov homepage COVID-19 OPIA banner | Recommend replacing the link to call their VAMC to link to this content to better direct traffic as appropriate. |
| High | VHA public health page | Add link in "What should Veterans do" section as well as in right column Resources section |
| High | Other VAMC website pages | VAMCs should be encouraged to link to this page |
| Med | External sites and social media | Encourage linking to this content whenever possible to aid users in best determining when to call, where to go, etc. rather than directing them straight to VAMCs or Call Center. |

The above linking opportunities rated "medium" or "low" are purely recommendations and can be utilized at your team's discretion.

## Redirects 

_Identify if any redirects are needed. This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only._

NONE

For redirects, please submit a Redirect Request at least 2 weeks in advance per the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).
