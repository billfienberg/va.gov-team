  o    Change the links to go to the main Decision Review page instead of the legacy appeals page in disability: [https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/)

**Add Left Nav**

* Add a left nav component to the Decision Reviews content area as either part of this work, or as follow up work, to improve navigation within this section of content.  
* Include a link to this new online form as a child of the Higher-Level Review content page
* Left nav was defined for this area previously but should be reviewed and revised as needed based on the addition of this option : [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/16360](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/16360)
