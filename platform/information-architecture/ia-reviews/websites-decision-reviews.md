# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** Public Websites

**Product/Featue:** IA improvements for Decision Reviews content

**Background/Context:** The AMA is in full effect as of Feb 19, 2020. The team wants to improve the findability of Decision Reviews content, as well as the UX for navigating the current content. The legacy appeals process will also need to be incorporated.

**IA Request:** [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6920](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6920)

## IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs 

_Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements._ 

**Approach**

* This goals of this solution are to
  * Bring both the legacy appeal and the new Decision Review process content together in one content area
  * Ensure entry points to this content are provided where applicable in the benefit section of VA.gov
  * Improve the navigation of the Decision Reviews area
* The approach to meet these goals, is to follow the hub and spoke approach used in our benefit hubs.  This requires the content of the primary Decision Reviews page be converted into the standard benefit hub template, content is arranged into Get/Manage type spokes and left hand navigation is added into the content area for easier navigation.

**URLs & Breadcrumbs**   
 _Please connect with your writer/editor on the proper verbiage and capitalization of the last element of the breadcrumb_

| Page | New URL | New Breadcrumb | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Manage a legacy appeal](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/) | www.va.gov/decision-reviews/legacy-appeals | Home &gt; VA decision reviews and appeals &gt; Manage a legacy VA appeal | - This existing page will be moved from disability to Decision Reviews content area   - The URL and breadcrumb will change as noted   - A redirect will need to be created for the URL change. See redirect info below.   The left nav on this page will need to reflect the new Decision Review hub left nav. |
| [Legacy request a priority review](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/request-priority-review/) | www.va.gov/decision-reviews/legacy-appeals/priority-review | Home &gt; VA decision reviews and appeals &gt; Manage a legacy VA appeal &gt; Request a priority review | - This existing page will be moved from disability to Decision Reviews content area   - The URL and breadcrumb will change as noted   - A redirect will need to be created for the URL change. See redirect info below.   The left nav on this page will need to reflect the new Decision Review hub left nav. |
| [Legacy Board of Veterans Appeals hearings](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/board-of-veterans-appeals/) |  |  | - This is an existing static page that will either be moved or retired...**TBD** |
| [Supplemental claim static page](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/) | No changes to URL | Home &gt; VA decision reviews and appeals &gt; Supplemental claims | - This is an existing static page and is only a change to the H1 and Breadcrumb to remove the action word "Request".  This will make it consistent with the other review type pages, clarify that this page is not where the action is executed, and reserves the action word for the future when the actual form comes online. |
| [Board appeals static page](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/board-appeal/) | No changes to URL | Home &gt; VA decision reviews and appeals &gt; Board appeals | - This is an existing static page and is only a change to the H1 and Breadcrumb to remove the action word "Request".  This will make it consistent with the other review type pages, clarify that this page is not where the action is executed, and reserves the action word for the future when the actual form comes online. |
