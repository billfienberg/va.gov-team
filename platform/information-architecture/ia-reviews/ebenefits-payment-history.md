## Additional Details/Recommendations

## Meetings Notes and Background Info

**Kick-off 3/19/2020**

* login and see payments issued to me, click on line item and see detail
* data table that is returned, leaning towards table data
* no transactional functionality, all just viewing data, may need some interactions i.e. sorting, pagination, filtering, etc
* usability testing needed
* VSP recommended looking at BAM2 order history work, as its tabular data,  as well Yellow Ribbon tool and Find forms
* amount of data returned is and could be very large
*
