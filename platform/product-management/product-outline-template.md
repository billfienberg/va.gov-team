## Overview

_After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating._

## Problem Statement

_In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address._ [_Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this_](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)

_Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... **\_**" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later._

## Desired User Outcomes

* _Why would a user want to use this?_
* _With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?_

## Undesired User Outcomes

## Desired Business Outcomes

* _Why would your business want this to exist?_
* _With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?_

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Assumptions

* _Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach \(next section\) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality_

## Solution Approach

* _What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?_
* _Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?_
* _What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?_
* _How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build \(knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way\)?_

## KPIs

* _What data \(qual or quant\) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?_

## Go-to-market Strategy

* _How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?_
* _What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?_

## Target Launch Date

* _What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?_
* _What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?_
