# Team of Teams Meeting

The goal of the Team of Teams meeting is for platform teams and teams building on VA.gov to understand how you may be impacted by each others' work. Knowing what each other is working on allows for collaboration, time-savings, and ultimately the creation of more great Veteran facing services.

## Process for submitting your team's info for Team of Teams

1. Take the template below, fill it in with your team's information, and send via a Slack message to the Team of Teams organizer \(currently Elizabeth Callaghan\) **before 10:00 AM ET on Tuesdays**
2. Join the meeting, listen in, participate in relevant Slack threads, present your team's updates when it's your turn, and share relevant updates back with your team.

_Note: if you've never presented in Team of Teams before, send a Slack message to Kevin Hoffman to coordinate._

## Submission Template:

**1. What are you actively working on shipping?**

_Include the name of the product/feature you're working on, the product lifecycle phase it's in, and at a high level what the current work is. If the product/feature in the build/validate phase, include what your anticipated launch plan and timeline is._

Like this:

* `Product/feature`: `discover/define/build/validate` phase, working on `user research/business validation/prototype validation/API integration/something else`, planning to launch to `target audience` on `mm/dd/yyyy`.

**2. What changes are you introducing that may impact other teams?**

_Include a quick description of the change, and why other teams should care_

Like this:

* We're `doing this thing` around `this time,` so `this person/group/team` please make sure to `do this as a result`

**3. What blockers or dependencies are impacting your progress?**

_Include a description of the blocker, and what you need from this group to overcome it_

Like this:

* In order to `do this thing`, we need `this other thing` from `this person or team`

**4. Q&A**

_The Team of Teams MC will fill this out during the meeting, leave it blank in your Slack submission_

**5. Action Items**
