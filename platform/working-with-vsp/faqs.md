## Recruiting for Research

1. _The \[sample recruiting emails\] say that Veterans can email `feedback@va.gov` with questions. Who monitors this email and can I get responses sent to it for my recruiting emails?_

   > No. The `feedback@va.gov` email address is only for DSVA use. You need to modify the sample recruiting emails to use your own email address, preferably your va.gov email address.

2. _Can I use my own recruiting screener?_

   > No. You must use the [DSVA recruiting screener](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md), which has PRA clearance and an approved OMB control number.

3. _We're planning to recruit Veterans in person at an event \(or location\). What is the best way to describe who we are to Veterans so that they trust us?_

   > You can say that you work for \[your company\] who is working on behalf of VA to do this research.  
   >  If you're handing out printed materials, your va.gov email address will also help legitimize you with the Veteran community.
