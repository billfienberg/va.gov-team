## Instructions

The VSP platform team is your offboarding concierge. All you need to do is:

2. Your last day
3. Your Github username
4. Your email address\(es\), including your va.gov address if applicable
5. Your project\(s\) team lead
6. Please fill out the [Offboarding Request template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=product+support%2C+operations%2C+Offboarding&template=offboarding-request.md&title=Offboarding+of+%5Bindividual%5D).
7. Be available to answer any questions the platform team may have.

Other than that, thank you for your service and have an excellent day!

In the event you need to offboard someone else because they have already left, please follow the above instructions on their behalf.
