# Remote friendly work practices

## Phone calls

* Good mic for room
* One person speaks at a time
* Speak toward the mic
* If there is a note-taker or anyone typing, try to postition them away from the mic
* Leave pauses or specifically solicit input from the remote folks

## Collaborative work

* Remote folks can't read stickies. Tools like mural.io or fun-retro can help.
* Don't have substantive conversations during walk from in-person, back to debrief
