# issues-from-april-2018-foresee-data

1. Often cited broken links, site errors inconsistency between eBenefits and vets.gov
2. **Only about 1/2 of visitors to va.gov and VHA Medical centers sites accomplished what they wanted to do**
3. Problem: education
   1. “**for the past month I have been trying to see if my education attendance has been reported and I can not see** if I am being reported to the VA as a student and I call everyday with no answer.” Sat: 0, 02/26/18 
4. Problem: place to submit a form - 
   1. “**Better navigation tools and options**. I find what I am looking for eventually, but it does take persistence. My fear is other vets who are not as persistent or tech and health savvy may not be well served by this VA portal.” Sat: 37, 03/28/18 
   2. “**Maybe just better access to submitted claims documents**. I could never view my docs submitted and was unsure if they were in the proper area. Other than that, the site is very helpful and informative. Nice job with all the upgrades! Thank you for your support to our Veterans.” Sat: 18, 11/20/2017 
5. **Users looking for Disability & Compensation and Healthcare were more likely than not to have gone through multiple VA websites**
6. Request to **Make it easier to find your account info**
   1. “Have more details about your account and where to submit supporting documents.” Sat: 0, 09/18/2017 
   2. “Re do the site and make it much easyer to find your account and get needed information.” Sat: 4, 06/10/2017 
7. **Password problems, especially when going across multiple sites**
   1. “a lot of problems signing into my eBenefits account. keep telling me user name or password was incorrect. Took me 4 attempts.” Sat: 44, 02/11/2018 
   2. “make passwords easier to use. There are too many rules, such as not being able to use dictionary words, etc. Its really hard for me to remember them, especially since they have to be changed every 90 days.” Sat: 78, 02/20/18 
   3. I don't come to this site often When I do I always have login issues due to the fact I don't have a need to use this site on a regular bases Lt me decide when to change my password I don't like it when a site tells me what I can and can't use as a password and when to change my password. I won't remember the password I just changed because of your criteria. It's my password.” Sat: 63, 03/14/18
