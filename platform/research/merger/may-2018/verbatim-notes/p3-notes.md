## Background Questions - 5 minutes \(:08\)

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

1. **Background: quadriplegic, has family assist him sometimes. Did not assist him during the sessions**
2. Which VA benefits have you used? 1. **I am a non-service connected, catastrophically disabled Veteran. So that's healthcare, adaptive and assistive devices for the home, respite care, home health care. Inpatient care through the VA. I also have Veterans Choice. Since I live &gt; 50 miles from the nearest VA facility, I can use that, though, I typically use my Medicare and Medicaid for that stuff. Other benefits… All my durable medical equipment comes from VA. I use mental health benefits. I have a spinal cord injury, so I'm eligible for more than if you were to break your arm and be non service-connected. I do receive a VA pension as well. Think that's about it.** 2. Education? home loan? 1. **I have been approved for a VA loan. have a certificate. I used my GI Bill in early 2000 - 2004 for college. The one I was using was expended.** 3. Did you apply online / find any info about benefits online? 1. **Not really. I was in a trauma unit in \[city\], and we had heard rumors from friends that I could potentiallly obtain care through the VA spinal cord program. Word of mouth more than anything. In looking it up online, was difficult to find non service-connected specific info. A lot of it was blanket "hey, this is how we cover\_" in 2014 when I first got injured. A lot of the info was specific to service-connected Veterans and their families, and retirees. To a point, there's still a lot that's focused on that. I've had difficulty even knowing some programs exist, finding info about them - whether or not the info pertains to non-service-connected. There's a program to receive a grant toward the conversion of a vehicle to be adapted to be handicapped accessible. Way of handling it for service-connected or non service-connecte is different. Service-connected can get funds every 2 or 4 years. Non service-connected can only get the grant once for life. I know there's some stuff going through that's supposed to change that. It's hard to discern which one goes with which. If I'm a non-service-connected Veteran, I might get confused, think that I get one every 2 or 4 years. It's not really well defined when there's a gap between what service-connected and non service-connected are eligible for. Healthcare hours. I get 28 hours a week. Someone with service-connected gets 40. Why do they get 40 and I am maxed out at 28 when I have the same needs. It's not really spelled out what the difference is: here's what you might get whereas here's what a service-connected Veteran would get. Because you don't really get that. You find two different things. You don't know if one supersedes the other when it comes to service-connected versus non-service-connected. That's been my biggest issue, figuring out whether some of the health benefits I have are applicable to me because of how I'm rated within the VA medical care system. Voc rehab, unless you're 20% service connected, you don't receive those benefits, but I'm a 100% catastrophic non-service-connected Veteran, and I need to get a job. They're covering everything else, so why not cover that stuff? Some weird things that are not covered / that are covered. That's kind of confusing to me. I graduated from Penn State School of Business. Halfway through a master's program. I use the Internet a lot. I'm a web developer. For me not to be able to find it, I know that people who aren't as ingrained with social media and research may not be able to do it at all and may not do it at all because of the frustration, and then you call, and some of the doctors don't really know until you get the person who actually coordinates the program who can tell you "service-connected gets this / non service-connected gets that". And the percentages you receive. I know that there are laws that are signed into congress that say what people get. That's what VA goes from. Congress says that we go with 60%, if a Veteran gets this and that. But those eligibility requirements are not well spelled out on any of the VA web properties as far as I'm able to tell. Those are things I find that Veterans want info for - "they've put me at this level, and what does that mean?" They don't have a way to find out. How much pension do I get? They don't know. There's a sliding scale thing online that's super hard to figure out. It's like using an abacus to do calculus. I hate to say it, but we're "keep it simple, stupid" people. You kind of have to have it spelled out. I know some of us don't, but if it's something I have to take more than a couple of steps to figure it out, then most people are just not figuring it out. It's sad because they deserve and they rate the benefits that are being provided, but they're ignorant about it, frustrated about it, or decided to bury it somewhere, which isn't good.**  2.

## Tasks

## Task: Apply for Disability Compensation - 8 minutes \(:16\)

Scenario: Pretend you don't have a disability rating from VA yet, but you have been diagnosed with PTSD, and you'd like to apply for disability compensation. Show where you'd go to submit the application online.

* **So I'm still kind of, I guess, not old school, since I use the internet to find info. I would go to contact us. I would go to toll-free numbers - I don't like that. I like "ask a question" better. If I had a form that I could fill out, enter my email, I would typically do that on top of making a phone call. For me, I just clicked on "ask a question". Thought it would be a form to fill out. I'm met with way too much stuff - that's just confusing. I expected to be able to just ask a question - "hey, what's your question" or maybe a dropdown that has some sample questions. MHV - don't know what that is if I haven't signed up already. I'm not in crisis. Toll free numbers. I'd go to this - find one near me. So I'm in \[state\] \(gets long list of locations\). So it would be nice to be able to put in my ZIP code and get the closest centers, but not all centers have the person that actually… the inbound person. What's the name of it - person who makes sure you meet all the requiremens to be part of VA. \[location\] has an office, and there's a person who sits in there. You bring in all your paperwork, and they tell you if you're eligible or not.  I think it's the eligibility office. If I'm new and I don't know about that stuff, which most people do not know, it would be nice to just be able to put my zip code in. \(types zip code in text field by "Locations" heading\) Since it doesn't say "put your ZIP code in here", people probably wouldn't know to do that. Okay, it's not giving me anything.**
* **We're still looking. I know there's one in \(town 1\). They might tell me to call the \(town 2\) number. So I'd either enroll there or enroll online.** 
* **Looking for a way to contact them online just through "contact us". Trying to find a toll free number. Then through the toll free number, thought I could find a facility in my state. Could just call there. Still don't have a phone number.**
* Tell me about the decision to find a contact number rather than trying to apply online or find info on the site.
  * **because I don't want to fill in the wrong thing \(application\). Mainly when it comes to any government document - you can find all kinds of copies of them on the Internet, but I don't know if that's the right one, if that's the one for this year, the right version. I'd rather have someone tell me - go to this website, fill this out, or yes, this is correct. Or if I went to "ask a question" and there was a dropdown that directed me to the page I was supposed to be on, I'd be more inclined to trust it. What happens is, Veterans fill out a form, do it wrong, or they submit it, and one of the required fields isn't working. So they just quit trying to do it. So it just needs to be simpler.**
  * **I went to "contact us" because, for me with the VA, I want to do everything through as many ways as possible. I'm going to contact my primary care, my social worker, whoever runs the program, I'm going to send an email, I'm going to make a phone call. All that stuff is going to get me some kind of response, typically more so than just doing one thing or the other. Just the way I do things.**
    * **But what should happen is - they should just be able to send a… I would assume that there's a good amount of traffic on the VA website, good amount of people who have questions who may or may not figure their way out through submission on this site. I didn't figure out how to submit here. That would be a good way to have that FAQ, more so to divert people. FAQ is probably one of the most used places on a site, in my professional opinion. Probaby more so on a huge information-heavy database site where you're looking for specific stuff. FAQ can be a great thing because it can day "where do I start" and it directs you, then you can find the next place to go and it directs you there.**
    * **It kind of makes more of a linear way of going through the site as opposed to just trying to figure it out. I need to be "horse lead to water" simple.**
    * **Benefits - I wouldn't go there. I know I get all these benefits, but reading about them isn't going to help me right now. What I need to know is, how do I get signed up to that point where I need to be reading about benefits. That's a secondary, tertiary step for me where it's like, "oh, I've got my info in. Now I'm going to read through this stuff so when someone does call me back, I'll know what I'm talking about." But initially, I just want to get somebody to talk to so that I can at least know a "no kidding" appropriate place to start, more so than me just clicking around and not knowing what I'm supposed to be looking at. That's why I went to contact us - usually a good place to start on any site, especially a small business that might have the president's name on it or the director of the outpatient clinic, so you can end up talking to decision makers as opposed to the secretary.**
  * Let's try to find the application step on the site by navigating through it. \[21:31\]
    * **\(Main nav - Benefits &gt; General Benefits Information\). Okay. \(loads VBA page\) \(reads through left nav items\). I'm looking for enrollment or eligibility. \(scrolls down\). Independent living program? Brochures, fact sheets, stories… \(pause\) Aha. Applying for Benefits. Applying for benefits home. \(lands on Applying for Benefits page\). How to apply. Pre discharge program. I've been discharged. That's Voc Rehab. Here again, it's like "I know I'm eligible for something" so now I need to fill out all this shit. Pension benefits. I wouldn't know. I know now, but 4 years ago, I wouldn't know. I just knew I had to go to the VA and turn in my medical records and they might give me money. That was it. That was in 2000. I got out again in 2007 and knew less. I was inpatient then and I broke my neck. 5-6 months in the actual hospital was the only way I learned a lot, and being an advocate for other Veterans, working with a VSO, all that helped out. Mostly what I see is like what I got here \(Applying for Benefits page\). Just a fucking bevy of information. Maybe an assault of information. There's a lot of information, and I don't know what to click on if I'm a new person.**
    * **Let me see if i can find something for disability compensation. Vocational Rehab. I'm looking for something that says "hey, enrollment or eligibility". PTSD, life insurance. sigh. I don't know. Let's just say it's disability. Wants me to go to eBenefits.**
    * Seems you were looking for something other than that. What were you looking for?
      * **Enrollment - start here, start now. Get your shit straightened out and start here. A call to action that makes me feel confident about what I'm clicking on, as opposed to a big, ambiguous page of links.**
    * Did this seem you got to the right place?
      * **Yeah, I would have found it regardless, but the average person, this is something they'd have a challenge with. Even I do as well.** 
      * **It's frustrating first admitting that you have a disability because you served in the military - people with PTSD, when they're going online to fill it out, anything that makes it more difficult exponentially multiplies their likelyhood to not do it. Decreases the number of people who are enrolled. There should be a big button on the website saying "enroll" or "start your benefits here by clicking". When Veterans go to the website, that's what they go there to do. Shouldn't have to guess. Should be blatant. Should be a pop-up but not that annoying, a call to action above the fold.**
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What would you need to qualify for disability compensation?
    * **\(from Applying for Benefits page\) Would go to apply online at eBenefits or I can fill out this form and send it in.**
    * In terms of understanding what you need to be eligible, would you just submit the application and see what happens?
      * **I would.**
      * **Okay, what you're asking is not to get to the place to turn them in, but whether I qualify to be able to turn them in. Okay, that's the kind of shit I can never figure out on here.**
      * **To me, it's like "hey, I'd rate everything", but then that's for service-connected people. So \(in side nav\) "Applying for Benefits", I would assume that if I'm supposed to learn about that before I apply, hm, "Compensation" \(in side nav\) &gt; "Evidence Requirements" \(opens Evidence Requirements sub-menu\), "Pension Exam" \(closes Evidence Requirements sub-menu\), \(pause…\) \(opens Evidence Requirements Page\) Okay, so discharge papers, okay. Separation papers, okay. Medical requirements, okay. Fully developed claim, expeditiously \(scrolls down\). All right. Basically this says I'm allowed to submit a claim and I should send in any evidence or treatment records that are relevant. I'd probably have the other screen up with the form that I was about to submit to them. down here under fully deveoped claim, Apply. Benefit rates \(opens benefit rates page\). None of this really drills down into: hey, if you have a 60% rating, your'e getting 250 dollars a month. If it does drill down to that I have to find it. "Select the compensation program below to view current rates." Okay, so Automobile Allowance, there we go \(clicks Automobile Allowance link\). $20,000 once. For more information, what the hell? Oh, great, so I get an automobile allowance. What does that mean? No idea. Might be applicable to me. Might not be. If I have to find out, I have to go through the whole automobile allowance crap to figure it out. Let's see what they say over there. \(clicks "automobile allowance page" link\)**
      * **"Servicemembers may be eligible…" instead of "may be eligible", they should specify who's eligible. It's there in writing somewhere in a Congressional fucking letter that says "non-service-connected Veterans at this level get this much for an automobile allowance". Basically what that grant is is the grant I received because my auto needed to be converted into a van that had a ramp that I could drive up and sit in. I was eligible for that. Why was I eligible for that? because I was considered 100% catastrophically disabled by the VA non-service-connected. In my case, it would say "if you're not service-connected, you would be eligible if…" It would just spell out exactly who's eligible. I know that might require more updating than they'd want to do on the website, but typically it's only every couple of years that they change all these frickin rules around.** 
      * **\(Eligibility Requirements, Adaptive Equipment heading\). Oh, there we go, there's the disability stuff. Have ankylosis, I don't even know what that is. Basically it means you can't pedal your car around. How to apply, here we go. So I know I can apply for that. Don't know if I need it, but I know I can apply for it.**
      * **Basically what happens is the VA sets you up with a physical, and you go "here's what's wrong", and they go, "yeah, that's wrong, but you also might have this, so we're going to get you set up with a social worker that can get you all of these benefits you're supposed to have".**
      * What were you able to determine as far as who's eligible?
        * **I know that it's basically up to the VA. I have to submit my dd214 and my medical records to determine what I'm eligible for?**
        * Based on this page, what can you find out re: auto allowance?
          * **\(reading\) Must have one of the following rated disabilities that are either rated as service-connected or treated as service-connected, or for a servicmeber the result of a disease incurred. Okay, so that's not me, for the grant \(referring to Eligibility Requirements Automobile Grant heading\).**  
          * **However, let me keep going here because I received the grant, so I don't know. \(reading Evidence Requirements\). Okay, so this is all service-connected. Even though I got the grant. There's nothing on here saying why I got the grant, so I have no idea. I'm not service-connected. I think this is exactly the page I looked at when I was looking at exchanging my van to get a truck. Thought I was eligible every 2-4 years. I had to call my social worker, and she said that's not the way it works. Everything says "service-connected", "service-connected", "service-connected", but I got money. If you look up this 38 U.S.C 1151, VA form, United States Code, that's what all this shit is written under. It spells out why I received it, but nobody is going to dig that far except the quadriplegic who sits in front of his computer all day. So obviously I can't just walk out and go about my day-to-day without fucking assistance, so I'm maybe more motivated to get on here and dig, but even when I really dug, it got to the point where I just had to make a phone call. I would assume the point of the website is to decrease the amount of phone calls and deal with issues in a less-expensive method, which is a page on the Internet.**
  * What information would you need to apply?
* _\[stop when participant gets to eBenefits or they say they would call someone or go to a VSO\]_

### Things to watch for:

* What is the participant's comprehension of eligibility and information they'd need to apply?
* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place to apply online?

## \(if they haven't done it before\) Task: Check Disability Claim Status - 7 minutes \(:23\)

_\[reset to_ [https://www.va.gov/](https://www.va.gov/)_\]_

Scenario: Pretend you have submitted your disability compensation application, a few weeks go by, and you want to check on the status of your claim. Show us how you'd accomplish that.

* **Guess I'd have to go back to eBenefits. \(clicks "how to apply" link\). Oh, \(link to\) eBenefits. Or I could just use that form \(VA form 21-526EZ\). So I could download that form and fax it in. Or go to a VA regional office. Oh, \(Veterans Affaris National Facilities Locator link\) here's that button I was talking about before. Oh, shit. All types. Just got me back to the same place that was not… Enter your address or ZIP code… that I failed with before, just hoping that it… Yay, all right. \(enters ZIP code into address field, successfully gets back a list of locations nearby\). Intake Centers, or benefits offices. Got \(location1\) or \(location2\). Doesn't have \(city\). All right or eBenefits. I'm going to go back here. \(clicking main navigation tabs\).**
* Okay, if you had submitted your application online, do you see a way you could check on the status of it online?
  * **Hm, I never used one. I'm trying to find the… \(clicks ebenefits link\). I'm assuming when you have this eBenefits thing, they somehow email you or there's some kind of dashboard. Manage, here we go. Status tracking \(on eBenefits\).**

### Things to watch for:

* Is the participant looking for a way to check claim status on va.gov?

## Task: Applying for healthcare - 7 minutes \(:30\)

Scenario: Think back to recently after you were discharged. You want to apply for health benefits through VA. Show us how you would go about that.

* **\(pause\) \(clicks health &gt; health care information from main nav, gets to VHA page\). \(pause\). \(types zip code in Hospital Locator under Quick Links in the left sidebar\) Kind of the same as before, trying to find my local place I can call and do what I need to do. I put in my zip code, and looks like, oh, I can just call this place and find out. That's the outpatient clinic that's by my house. They could tell me what I need to do. Is this an urgent thing?** 
* No, this is just getting set up for long-term
* **So I'd call that and they'd tell me to go to one of these websites here. Oh, here's a better thing \(uses "I am A" field, chooses "Veteran"\). It has a little bit of a call to action dropdown where I can select who I am so it can provide the information that's more pertinent to me, rather than information I don't need. That's the problem. There's a lot of stuff that's either you don't need it, or it's written in a way where you can't tell what you need.**
* **\(reading\) Ah, apply for health benefits. \(clicks link, gets to Easy Ways to Apply for Enrollment page\). By telephone, all right, here we go. So I would pick one of these.**
* If you wanted to apply online, where would you go for that?
* **\(clicks "healthcare application" link under "apply online" heading, goes to vets.gov\). Looks lilke it's going to take me… Vets.gov. Process &gt; check your eligibility? okay. I think this is what I looked at. Actually, I remember this page when I was in the hospital. I was in the VA hospital trying to figure out what I needed. All right. Find out how to apply. blah, blah. "Apply for healthcare benefits" \(clicks button\).**

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Based on what we went through, what did you find most challenging to find? How could it be better?
  * **Probably knowing what the eligibility requirements are, for everything. That's the thing - whether or not. It's just difficult. The hardest part would be - I would want the simplest thing to be where I could submit my info. Seemed to be the hardest thing to understand whether or not I needed to do it. Even if I read through all the eligibility requirements, you don't know unless you apply, honestly. Regardless of what the thing says, I'm going to apply and see if I get it. To me, that makes it harder to apply, even though it was harder to find it, seemed to make it more difficult of a choice. Some guys might go, "it looks like I'm not eligible - I quit". I would fill out the damn thing anyway, and call and figure out. Have somebody else tell me that I'm wrong or I'm not eligible. I wouldn't just not apply. But I have a different understanding of the VA and service-connected or non-service connected and all that, than someone who is 21 and just getting out of the service would have. The hour class on how to sign up with the VA doesn't really work with them, especially when they think they're the bee's knees when they're getting out of the service, nobody thinks they're hurt.**
  * **I think clearer eligibility requirements. I know the ones were just like "we need your dd214 and medical records". Okay, that's great. I'm just going to trust. One is just you need to trust the VA that they're going to do everything they're supposed to do to ensure that you're getting the benefits you deserve, whereas you're not able to double check that because it's difficult to find them and pinpoint why you're not getting it or why you are getting it. The eligibility info seems to be the hardest thing, to be able to double-check it. Because my care - my types of benefits I've received have changed in the past 3 years. Some have gotten better, some have stayed the same, some have just changed names. They're named differently depending on the region or district you're in. I would say, if they could make the eligibility info a little more dumbed down, that would be better. Or just a big button that says "apply here", and we'll go figure it out. One or the other. Real simple info or just a big button that says "apply here. this is where you get started". And even there you could ask, "what do you think is wrong with you?" and you say what it is, and it goes to the next page. Submit claim. Like the Geico website, how they do their claims. Okay, I got in a wreck. my back hurts. I go online or go on the app and go, "here's my info". I'm a member. I'm screwed up. Here's what you need. Your dd214 says you're a member of the VA. whether they take care of you depends on the rest of it. Medicaid does that too. "how many people do you live with?", "What's wrong with you?", "What does your doctor say is wrong with you?"** 
  * **Obviously the VA has to do a physical, but I think that would be a big help as far as Veterans enrolling would be to have a bigger button on the front page or a call to action, which is what that "I am A" thing was, but now it's gone. I have to click on health to get back to it. If that was on the homepage, that would even help. I don't see - benefits, yeah, or maybe in this benefits section maybe "enroll" or "apply for benefits".**
* Any questions for me?
  * 50:13 - 50:44 \(PII about growing up\)
  * **I hope you're staying busy with these. I know a lot of Veterans have a lot of insight, they just have a hard time doing something constructive with it.**
  * **I do all my stuff through MyHealtheVet now, which is not bad**
  * **There's so much info the VA has to get out there. It's burdensome, I know, but if they could strip their site down and maybe get more into what do people actually look at and click on. They need to put clickbait in there for fricken enrollment. Those pop-ups are there for a reason. People put that stuff on websites because that's how people know what to do. Nobody wants to read through all this stuff. They just want something to pop up in their face that says "enroll for your benefits" or at least somewhere on the front page so you know where to go. There are so many places to go on this site, it's difficult to weed them out.**
