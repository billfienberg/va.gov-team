## Background Questions - 5 minutes \(:08\)

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

1. Which VA benefits have you used?
   1. **Voc Rehab. And I'm using the insurance… not the insurance, but using my primary care at the VA. Sometimes they don't have an appointment so refer you to another provider. Also using prosthetics. gotten humidifier, gotten orthotics. Using dental. used the eye doctor. I've used MyHealtheVet. That's all I can think of, but I probably use more. Also disability compensation - 90% now.**

About finding info on va.gov

1. How often do you come to va.gov?
   1. **I don't use it that often because I haven't found it to be very helpful. Not user friendly. I usually go to MyHealtheVet. I see now it's a little different from what I'm used to.**
   2. What do you come to the site for?
      1. **Think I was just trying to find info or numbers. I was trying to find rules and regulations for prosthetics for a wig. Took me to a VA document. It wasn't that useful. Info is hard to find or I don't find a direct number, so it's useless to me.** 
      2. What did you do at that point
         1. **Call the VA. I called the 1-800 number where you can call someone for help, or I call the hospital I'm currently enrolled in.**
   3. Did you start applications for Voc rehab, disability, healthcare on va.gov?
      1. **No. When I come to va.gov, I'm Googling, trying to find some info, educate myself, and it comes up short, so I've never tried to do anything on the website.**
      2. **I have used the email support - I got an email back in a timely manner**
      3. **There are times where people don't know the answer or people aren't up front with you. So I might be looking for a document or a code number, document that tells you what the procedure is. Lots of paperwork. Sometimes I'll google it, and the dept of VA is one of the results that comes up.  I'll press the link, and it's usually not very helpful. It's not what I'm looking for, so I have to keep scrolling. So I never say "let's go to the website". I have found that it's not that helpful.** 
      4. **Yesterday. I'm having a problem with one of the benefits. A document came up, but the document didn't have the info I was looking for. That's usually the case. It gives me what I already know or what I wasn't looking for. I have to search a lot in other places. Maybe it's not the website but just the content.** 
      5. **It was about getting a wig. Trying to get VA to pay for a wig. I was having a problem with a lady who told me she would do one thing, and now she's not, and now she's saying VA doesn't pay for that - it's coming out of her own pocket, but it seems like she's lying, and I was trying to do research for myself to see what the proper protocol and what the rules were. I was able to pull something up on VA.gov. It was so skimpy. It was just a couple of lines saying "we don't pay for this". Had to keep searching to find out what the protocol was. It was a small outline. I was looking for a large outline of what I was entitled to, but it didn't have it. there wasn't any place I could find it.**
   4. Have you:
      1. Applied for disability compensation from VA?
         1. Checked on the status of a disability claim?
      2. Applied for VA healthcare?
         1. Managed prescription refills?
         2. Sent / received secure messages with your healthcare team?
      3. looked up information about treating a medical condition on va.gov?
      4. Sought out home loan benefits?
      5. Sought out education benefits?
2. Tell me about an experience you've had with va.gov
   1. What were you trying to accomplish?
   2. How did it go trying to do that?
   3. How might it have been better?

## Tasks

## Task: Apply for Disability Compensation - 8 minutes \(:16\)

Scenario: Pretend you don't have a disability rating from VA yet, but you have been diagnosed with PTSD, and you'd like to apply for disability compensation. Show where you'd go to submit the application online.

* **\(Mouses over Benefits in main nav, mouses over disability compensation\). Yeah, super simple. \(clicks disability compensation\). Actually, I did it myself on eBenefits. I wasn't super aware you could do it here. I guess I could have guessed That's cool. \(I am a \_ Veteran, Active Duty Service Member, Caregiver / Family Member, etc…\). I might do this \(selects I am a Veteran\). It didn't do anything \(slow connection, droppdown closed, but page is not loading immediately\). I guess I thought I was going to find it super fast, but I'm not seeing any button right now. If I were on my phone, if this were phone accessible, that would be great. I like applying on my phone. Oh, apply is right here \(in side nav under compensation\). I was just being stupid. 80% or a high percent of people who come to this page are looking to apply. You know how it was on that other page \(Apply for Healthcare on Vets.gov\). I was looking, looking, looking, and I couldn't find it here. I was getting stressy-pressy. Technically I can't do it from this website. It's going to take me to eBenefits. All right… I just thought there was a way to do it on the website. I'd just do it through eBenefits, but I guess people who don't know that you do it on eBenefits would come here and be led to the right place. That's fine. I was just thinking that you could do it from this website too. Okay, I'm not reading all of that. I don't have time to read all of that. I'm just going straight to eBenefits. And now we're here \(eBenefits\).** 
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What would you need to qualify for disability compensation?
  * What information would you need to apply?
* _\[stop when participant gets to eBenefits or they say they would call someone or go to a VSO\]_

### Things to watch for:

* What is the participant's comprehension of eligibility and information they'd need to apply?
* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place to apply online?

## \(if they haven't done it before\) Task: Check Disability Claim Status - 7 minutes \(:23\)

_\[reset to_ [https://www.va.gov/](https://www.va.gov/)_\]_

Scenario: Pretend you have submitted your disability compensation application, a few weeks go by, and you want to check on the status of your claim. Show us how you'd accomplish that.

* _\[stop when participant gets to eBenefits\]_

### Things to watch for:

* Is the participant looking for a way to check claim status on va.gov?

## Task: Applying for healthcare - 7 minutes \(:30\)

Scenario: Think back to recently after you were discharged. You want to apply for health benefits through VA. Show us how you would go about that.

* **\(goes to benefits in main nav, mousing over various sub-menu items\). "General benefits information". No, no. none of this looks like what I'm looking for, so I'll go to "health" \(in the main nav\). "Health Care Information". Thinking it might be there. Oh, "Access Your Health Benefits", Maybe that's it. At this point, I don't feel super confident. \(clicks "Health Care Information"\). When you asked for PTSD, I was confident that I was going in the right direction. I don't feel so confident now.**
* **Okay, awesome. I see the info on health benefits. I'm going to scroll down and see. I'm thinking it's here, "Apply for health benefits" \(right sidebar under "resources"\). Hoping that's it. \(clicks the link\) At the same time, maybe I'm not sure because everyone gets health benefits when they get out, to my knowledge. A lot of Veterans aren't sure. Especially if they didn't get medically discharged. "Can I get this, or not? Is this for me?" because it's different. Insurance at the VA, Tricare or whatever. If you're 100% disabled or even 80 or 90, then you get everything for free, so it's kind of confusing. I'd click "Apply for VA Care" \(in side nav\). I didn't even know you had to apply, to be honest. Oh, "Apply to enoll". I'm feeling very confident now. I tried to do that with the telephone. Very sucky. I think it's best to go to the hospital. I didn't even know you could do it online. If I knew that, I probably would have applied online if it's not too crazy a process. I'm hoping it's not.**  
* **\(loads Health Care Application Process page on vets.gov\) Okay, I'm very happy! \(sometimes there are\) too many words. I really like this setup a lot. Feels like it's not going to be too difficult. Not going to be hard. I see it. I see the tab. It seems really easy. I like it.**
* **Oh, I like that that's \("if you're signed into your account, your application process can go more smoothly. Here's why"\) in bold. Because now I'm going to read it. Oh, you can prefill. Ooh. Now I'm going to sign in. Oh, I want to see what's down here. Just stuff - looking at the 1-2-3-4. Simple. Easy, breezy, beautiful, Cover Girl. I like it. I had no idea this was here.**
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What would you need to qualify for health benefits?
  * What information would you need?
* _\[stop when participant gets to vets.gov\]_

### Things to watch for:

* What is the participant's comprehension of eligibility and information they'd need to apply?
* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place to apply online?

## \(if they haven't done it before\) Task: Prescription Refills - 7 minutes \(:37\)

Scenario: Suppose you got set up with VA healthcare, and you want to start managing your prescription refills online. How would you go about that?

* _\[stop when participant gets to MHV\]_

### Things to watch for:

* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place to manage refills online?

## \(if they haven't done it before\) Task: Secure messaging - 7 minutes \(:44\)

Scenario: Now you have some new symptoms and you want to send a secure message to your doctor to ask about how to manage them. Show us how you'd accomplish that.

* **in MyHealtheVet itself. Before, it was really great, but now, it's hard to get back and find that message you had just written. And then you have to go back. I can't even explain it unless I see it. It's very confusing, and I don't think it's very user friendly.**
* **I would never use secure messaging on va.gov.**
* Have you tried to navigate to it from VA.gov?
  * **I'd probably go to schedule an appointment or refill a prescription. I'm clicking "schedule a VA appointment" because I know that's one of the things that MHV does. Figure that would take me to MHV. Or I might go to "resources" \(in the main nav\) and see. I don't see it there, so I'll press again \(clicks "schedule a VA appointment" below the carousel again\). It's not working. \(clicks "schedule a VA appointment" in right sidebar under "are you interested in?" heading\). Oh, maybe this is it. "there are many ways forr Veterans to make health care appointments". Okay. I'd go here probably \("Schedule a VA appointment online" toward the bottom of the page\).** 
  * **I don't know if it's easier now, but a couple of years ago, I don't know who I called. Might have been va.gov. A really nice man helped me to set up a premium account. It was maybe 2-3 years ago. Maybe it's easier to do now. I didn't even know you had to upgrade. I don't know why I bothered to be honest.**
  * So you're thinking you'd click into upgrade your account to get to MHV, and from MHV be able to get to secure messaging?
    * **I think so. Sounds like a good plan to me.**

### Things to watch for:

* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place?

## \(if they haven't done it before\) Task: Info on a condition - 7 minutes

Scenario: You'd like to find out info about how to treat PTSD. Show us how you would do that on va.gov.

* **\(Health in main nav\) - I see PTSD right there. I think that's great. \(scrolls down to bottom block on the page - clicks link, "get help with VA PTSD care, benefits or claims"\). Yeah, I would go here. I'd probably look for a number to be honest. Or "overview". Let's see \(mousing over side navigation\). \(sigh\). I mean… "patient representative". VA Benefits Information. That's not what I'm looking for. \("PTSD Information Voicemail"\) Voicemail. That's not hepful. I'm trying to think if I had PTSD, what would I do. I feel like this is the right page. I think, well, how are they going to help me? it's a voicemail. If someone with PTSD is looking at this page, they're probably struggling. I'd probably call the Veteran Crisis Line. If the Veteran was connected with a VA medical center, think they'd be able to get me in there, or if they could connect with my primary care doctor, hopefully relatively fast. To me, I don't know exactly where I am. I was here before \(VA &gt; Health Care &gt; PTSD: National Center for PTSD\). Didn't see a lot of help. Email, that can take days, especially if it's a Friday. Only thing that I found helpful was the Veteran Crisis Hotline. Liked that it was on the side, that was helpful.**
* Find info on how to manage symptoms on your own.
  * **I was just there a second ago. \(toggles PTSD accordion in the side nav\). Awareness - maybe they can help me, give me tips \(goes to awareness page\). Learn, connect. I'm not trying to connect. I'm trying to help myself! Maybe here - Learn. \(tries to click the "Learn" heading\). See if it's a link. I guess it's not. \(clicks "PTSD basics" link\). Oh, but I saw a document I can download. Read "Understanding PTSD and PTSD Treatment \(PDF\)". That's perfect \(clicks link\). And then there's a video that I also saw, which might be helpful, eh, not sure if it would be helpful. "What is PTSD" - I already know what PSTD is. I'm looking for someone to help me. I would just go here \(to the PDF\).**
  * How did you feel about how easy / difficult it was to find
    * **I think it was really easy. Pretty straight to the point. Pretty well done. to my understanding, they would just call. I don't really see a place where they could just call. \(Clicks "PTSD Consultation" sidebar nav link from "National Center for PTSD" page\). Okay, maybe this is it. Is this the number they would call? Oh, that's pretty easy.** 
    * What do you expect with that number?
      * **Well, it's an 866 number, so thinking I would be waiting for a while, but thinking they'd connect me with someone at my local VA, put it in as a referral, and maybe the VA would call me back. Hoping they'd be able to set up an appointment, not sure if it would be primary care or behavioral health, hope it would be both. Maybe if someone is interested in a service dog, they could help with that. At least give steps in going in that direction or whatever they need, if the Veteran is having a problem with the person they're communicating with now, they could be an advocate.**
  * Looking through the PDF: Understanding PTSD and PTSD Treatment
    * **I like the pictures with the regular looking people, because we're people too. \(reading table of contents\) "What is PTSD, what are the symptoms, what do I do if I have symptoms". Eh, I might go there. "PTSD Treatment, why get treatment, common questions". Okay, where can I go. \(pages\) 8 and 14. \(scrolls down through pages\). What page am I on? That's 6. That's 7. I guess I can do that. Wait. I'll just do 8. I think this is a good one "What do I do if I have symptoms". \(goes to page 14, "where can I go to get help"\). I don't think any of these answer the question you're asking me. I don't think this is helpful then for that question.**
    * Let's go back up to the index. What was it you were expecting to see? Let's go back to "what do I do if I have symptoms". What were yu expecting to find here?
      * **Maybe some suggestions. \(reading\) "what other problems do people with PTSD have?" Yeah, maybe some suggestions on how to cope, how to manage. Possibly. I know that's not it says, but it says "what do I do if I have it", so maybe instead of seeing… a lot of people don't like, especially people with PTSD, going to see doctors "I'm a big boy / girl; I can do it myself", so what tips can I use: breathing deep, I don't know, maybe some suggestions.**

### Things to watch for:

* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place?

## Task: Home loan - 7 minutes

Scenario: You're getting ready to buy a home. You heard that VA provides a home loan benefit, and you want to learn more. How would you go about it?

* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What kinds of home loan benefits does VA provide?
* _\[stop when participant gets to eBenefits\]_

### Things to watch for:

* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place?

## Task: Education benefits - 7 minutes

Scenario: You're getting ready to enroll in college courses, and you heard VA might provide eduation benefits. Find out what VA offers and begin to apply.

* **\(opens benefits in main nav\) At first I was looking over here \(right sidebar under "are you interested in?"\) where it says "exploring your benefits", but I feel like I might go there if it wasn't here \(under benefits in main nav\). See GI Bill or Voc Rehab, depending on which one. Does it matter which I go to?** 
* Let's go to GI bill since I know you've done Voc Rehab before
* **\(clicks GI Bill link\). Okay. Transition assistance, compensation, applying for Benefits. I'm thinking it would be under "applying for benefits, but I'm not realy sure". Oh, "education and training" \(opens menu\). Maybe that's it. About GI Bill. I don't know. I thought I was looking to apply for the GI Bill. I had friends who asked me how you apply, and I don't know what to tell them. I applied on \_ app. I did it while I was still in - someone helped me on a base. I'm having a hard time. I'll go to GI Bill. It's either there or under "apply for benefits", but I think under "apply for benefits", it might be other things like compensation or trying to get a loan. \(opens "about GI bill" in sub-nav\) There are so many other benefits.  Oh, so this is not it. I don't think this is it. "Choose a School" \(tab under carousel\)? Maybe. Oh, "Apply for Benefits" \(tab under carousel\). \(clicks "Apply for Benefits" tab under carousel, clicks "Apply for Benefits" link under it.\) Oh, Applying for VA Education Benefits \(reading body text\)! So that was it.**
* **Interesting. I think - when it says "apply for benefits", I'm thinking of other benefits. There are so many benefits, I'm not sure what I'm applying for. Might think I'm applying for compensation.** 
* **\(clicks "apply for benefits" link on the "apply for benefits" page\)**
* Thoughts on application process on vets.gov
  * **I like the setup. Like how it lays out "here's the application process". It's not like "what do I do now?" you just scroll down and it's on the page. don't have to "click here to begin". Start on information.** 
  * **I think a cool idea: pick your school, if you could put a link to the GI Bill calculator… what's it called? yeah, the comparison tool. Oh, it's right here, just kidding. I really like that there. I don't know if someone would know what it meant unless they had background knowledge. Might ask "what am I comparing"? but I love that it's on the page.**
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What kinds of education benefits does VA provide?
    * **\(back on va.gov\) - mousing around under "for students" &gt; "get started". You want me to find out about benefits? I think I just missed it. "For students"… Oh, that's hard. Let me see. "Apply for benefits", "CareerScope", "payment rates", "School Decision Resources". No. Maybe "About GI Bill". Nope.**
    * Something you're scanning for?
    * **I'm looking for something that's like… what was the word you used? maybe I'm not getting it right.**
    * **I don't see anything. Maybe under Education Programs. I can't figure out honestly where it is. Maybe it's under this \("education programs"\) and you go to each one, like GI Bill, it would be the benefits for that. Obviously the benefits for GI Bill and the benefits for Voc Rehab are different. So maybe that's where I'm confused. Maybe it's the question.**
    * **\(opens Post-9/11 GI Bill\) Okay, you have to have that. "Types of training and assistance". So those are the benefits… Okay, right here. \(scrolls down to benefits and eligbiility heading\), but each one is different, so I guess I would have to try to decide which one do I want to do. Because if I wanted to go to Voc Rehab, then I would obviously press that one and see what the benefits of Voc Rehab are and mentally compare them to the GI Bill.** 
    * We've heard that the relationship of Voc Rehab and education benefits is confusing.
      * **I wouldn't say it's confusing, but they're different. When you asked the question, it's confusing. Not confusing, but just different. You're asking about education benefits, but GI Bill and Montgomery are different from Voc Rehab. And Voc Rehab is an extension of the GI Bill, but in my opinion, it's better. You could ask that, but I feel like if you ask that, then I have to go to each one and show you what it is. I don't see where there's a place to see "getting my education from the VA" as one unit. Because they're different, so it wouldn't make sense for them to be all in one place anyway, I guess? Or you can, but that's my mindset.** 
      * Sounds as though you're thinking about the benefits more holistically than how they're shown here?
        * **Yeah. I see that they're listed, so it's not really a problem in my opinion the way it's listed.**
  * What would you be eligible for  
  * What info would you need to apply?
* _\[stop when participant gets to vets.gov\]_

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Based on what we went through, what did you find most challenging to find? How could it be better?
  * **I think education was the hardest one.** 
    * Rate it 1 \(most difficult\) - 5 \(easiest\)
      * **2.5, maybe 3. I kept forgetting the question. I feel like I never really found it.**
    * How might it have been better?
      * **A different question. I think the question was… I don't know. Can I go back? \(goes to VA &gt; VBA &gt; education and training page\). I guess this part \(side nav\). I'm looking to see something that says "education benefits". I feel I didn't really see that. I just am seeing all the different things. \(opens education & training\). Oof, I don't even know where to go. \(opens Students\) okay, that's a "no", so I'm feeling less confident. Am I even in the right place? I don't even know what's happening \(opens Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment\). That's not where. Hm, I don't feel confident on this page. I felt the most confident in other pages. It's just not very clear, and there's lots of different tabs, and I don't know which one to go to.**
* Any questions for me?
  * **No. Thanks for letting me do this. I think it's so much fun.**
