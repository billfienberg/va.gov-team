## Background Questions - 5 minutes \(:08\)

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few background questions.

1. Which VA benefits have you used?
   1. **Of course I'm on \(disability\) compensation, service-connected. Used education. I believe the complete overhaul kind of education. I got a second degree because my first degree wasn't going to be enough for me to live off of if something happened to my husband. Yes, Voc Rehab is what I'm talking about with education and training. Have not done home loans, have not done any remodeling to make things accessible.**

About finding info on va.gov

1. How often do you come to va.gov?
   1. **Depends. Sometimes daily. sometimes I don't need to be on there for a couple of weeks.**
   2. What do you come to the site for?
      1. **Mainly I check the healthcare aspects. but sometimems it's for research, trying to find out what's available to us, what's available for someone else. I have a lot of friends who are Veterans, and I help them. Show what they're qualified for or may be qualified for.**
      2. So you are getting VA healthcare?
         1. **yes**
   3. Have you:
      1. Applied for disability compensation from VA?
         1. Checked on the status of a disability claim?
      2. Applied for VA healthcare?
         1. Managed prescription refills?
         2. Sent / received secure messages with your healthcare team?
      3. looked up information about treating a medical condition on va.gov?
      4. Sought out home loan benefits?
      5. Sought out education benefits?
2. Tell me about an experience you've had with va.gov
   1. What were you trying to accomplish?
      1. **I needed to schedule a VA appointment - that was the last time I went on there.**
   2. How did it go trying to do that?
      1. **It worked really well. Someone got back to me. Think I did it in the evening, so nobody was there, but they got back to me first thing the next morning.** 
   3. How might it have been better? Any challenges?
      1. **There was something that was confusing or frustrating. A couple months ago I went to send an email to a specialist that I had an appointment with, and I had seen them, but I couldn't email them through the site. I had to email somebody to make sure they were on there - that I could email the person. Took a day or two, and it was somewhat frustrating, but in the end, it was all straightened out.**
3. When you first applied for benefits - through VA.gov?
   1. **Yes, it was wonderful. Voc Rehab. Almost 5 years ago. Worked out really, really well. I think I did it through eBenefits.**

## Task: Home loan - 7 minutes

Scenario: You're getting ready to buy a home. You heard that VA provides a home loan benefit, and you want to learn more. How would you go about it?

* **Luckily, it's right there in front of me. \(Your Benefits: Active Guard Reserves. Actually, instead of going to General Rules for eligibility or Certificate of eligibility, I'm going to go to the full benefit page \(clicks "view full benefit page" link\) because I think that way I can look at both of those pieces of info at the same time. And I was right \(tabs through Benefits\). I believe these are the different programs I could enter in. Many states. I assume if I click "learn more" I'd go to a page that has me select my state and tell me what resources my state would offer. So the adaptive housing grants. I think we talked about this person not having a service-connected disability, so this may not apply now, but I'll remember it for the future. Native American. That's interesting. I didn't realize there was something specific for working on homes that are on federal trust land, on a reservation. If I already have an existing loan, this \(refinance\) is good to know. I think I need to know about the initial purchase loan. Find out about this one. So \(reading\) this is good. I see the no down payment. This is all really good information, so now i'm going to find out about eligibility. \(clicks Eligibility under Purchase in the side nav\). So I have to have satisfactory credit, sufficient income. I'm going to read through this and then come back to that because I want to find out more about that. Buy a home, improve a home. Eligibility Requirements, okay. \(clicks Certificate of Eligibility link\). I'm not familiar with this, so I'm actually reading it. Like I said I haven't gone through this at all. We didn't need to do this, and it wouldn't have worked for what we were going to do. Looks like if I'm a reserve member and I'm out, I'm a full veteran, I just need my 214. If I'm active duty, looks like I need a statement of service. Why wouldn't FitReps or DEERS show that you'd be active. Why wouldn't the VA already have a statement? I'd just go to DEERS and say "look at that - I'm still getting paid. I'm still active duty."**
* Suppose you're a Veteran in this scenario.
  * **Okay, looks like all I need is the dd214. Scroll down. I assume there's an application. Oh, look, I can apply online. \(clicks link to eBenefits\).**
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What kinds of home loan benefits does VA provide?
    * **Looks like different loans you can make to update your existing structure. You can get a loan to adapt, so that's the existing structure. To also - trying to remember - to buy a new home, obviously. To get a better interest rate, and to build a home.**
    * What are your thoughts on this option versus going with a private lender?
      * **Just depends on what you've got. I know a lot of people who are not in the habit of saving - they're in the habit of spending, or if you don't have a lot of credit. I know a lot of people, especially if they go through the OCS program, they may already be married, but maybe they don't have a lot of credit. Maybe they just got out of college or something like that. This one would provide - no interest, willing to work with your lender, and they guarantee it. they have a warranty on it, I think I saw. So yeah, the no down payment, the insurance premium. A lot of that - the up front cost is what stops a lot of people from being able to buy a house or build a house. They have a steady job, in the military, they're getting paid, and they know that unless they do something really bad, they're going to get paid. I think that would be something really good with the home loan advantage. Looks as though you don't have to have a lot of money up front. You can walk in and almost do a rent to own situation.**

### Things to watch for:

* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place?

## Task: Education benefits - 7 minutes

Scenario: You're getting ready to enroll in college courses, and you heard VA might provide eduation benefits. Find out what VA offers and begin to apply.

* **\(under Benefits in lower part of homepage &gt; Education & Training link\) I'd go here. I'm looking over. I see tuition assistance, compensation, training, Voc Rehab & employment. Any of those 4 could apply to me. \(tabs\) Apply for Benefits. Choose a school. Pretty sure this works at any school. You said you want me to find tuition assistance?**
* **Tuition assistance \(in side nav\). Where am I? I'd be in the reserve if I just got out. I see raditional & Technician. Resources, Benefits. VA forms. Let's just look. This talks about title 32. Active reserve. Traditional. Technician. \(tabs\) Okay, I am in the reserve, and I want to look at the benefits. \(gets to Your Benefits: Active Guard Reserve page\)**
* Was there something you were looking through with each of those tabs?
  * **I was looking for what specifically applied to my situation. So once you get out of the military, you're in the active reserve, so that's where I went. I went through all of them to make sure that's where I was supposed to be, make sure I was right. To make sure that's what I fell under.**
  * **\(Scrolling through Your Benefits: Active Guard Reserve page\) Post 9/11 GI bill, Montgomery GI Bill, Edcucational Assistance program. Let's say I was discharged without a service-connected disability, or I was but I wasn't compensated. I'd look for the Reserve Educational Assistance program \(clicks link\). Says that it's not found. \(404 error\). I'm going to look at the apply for benefits page \(clicks link\) Okay, this site is kind of corrupted too \(unstyled page\). I mean I can still do it. Apply online. That's GI Bil home. That's the VONAPP. So I'm going to launch VONAPP. That's not working \(404 error\).**
  * Okay, looks as though you found a place where you should be able to apply.
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What kinds of education benefits does VA provide?
    * **Looks like I would be eligible for it. 2001 was a fairly long time ago. I'm just going to assume I served active duty after that for at least 3 months. I don't remember what it said, but I'm going to assume. I believe i could look at eBenefits. Not going to do that quite yet. Just going to scroll down and look: life insurance, disability comp, VR&E.**
    * **What I really notice is these are really small \(footer links\). Even when I enlarge the screen, it still doesn't really make them bigger. There's a lot of information here. The quick list is supposed to be quick and short. I almost feel like you could hover over quick list, and a box could come up. or you could have quick list and apply for benefits and have other stuff under there like eBenefits - you could click this and stuff would come up. Life insurance would be under health care. Same thing with the typeface here. When I go to other sites, it's like "whoa the text is so big." at the same time, I can really see it. Almost like a font size 14. This looks like it's a 9 or a 10. Looks really, really small on my screen.**
    * **Well, they've got tuition assistance for various levels of government, guard, the active reserves, people who are still in but getting ready to go out. They could go straight from military to college. They could start taking classes while they're active duty still. Let's go to Compensation \(side nav\) and see what it says. I was just clicking on compensation to see if it was I thought it was. At first because it was sandwiched between education and training and Voc Rehab, I thought it was compensation for going to school, like you could go to school and submit your receipts, but it looks like it's more about disability compensation. I'd almost put that underneath or below services or applying for benefits. Voc Rehab. Whoa, that's a lot of tabs to look through \(opened voc rehab sub menu\). I almost feel like some of this stuff could just be on the homepage. Like the success stories. It almost seems redundant. Why have a homepage if you're going to have all of these different tabs. You could click on this, go to voc rehab home. Or have voc rehab home and have veteran employment resources or just vets success and the VOW to hire heroes. Seems those are the only ones you need under voc rehab and employment, and the other stuff could easily fall under the..**
    * **So Voc Rehab home and then vets success and VOW to hire heroes. Those seem like the main 3 programs under Voc Rehab & Employent. Those seem like the things that should be there. Then under Voc Rehab, yoou could have employment resources, independent living, under each of those screens, so that you could go to a page that has info about each one specifically. It's almost overwhelming.**
    * **\(scanning side nav, opens Applying for Benefits\). I don't think that's what I need. So That's transition assistance, not tuition assistance. \(opens Education & training\) \(opens for students\) \(opens Education programs\). looking at get started. Now I'm seeing a whole list of different education programs that are available. What if you had a Get Started - that was the only one, and underneath Get Started, or on that page - on the Get Started home, then it went through a series of yes/no questions and helped you pick the right one for you. Am I getting ready to move? or what career am I looking for? Am I willing to move? If you're looking for a career in nursing, and the closest school to you doesn't have a nursing degree, you just spent all this time researching, when this simple yes/no question could have said "there aren't any nursing programs here. Are you willing to move?" When I look under Education Programs, that's a ton. Maybe I don't know if I want to do an apprenticeship or a licensing certification. That means I have to look at both of those before even getting started and finding out if I'm even allowed to do it.**
    * What would you do at this point?
      * **Using the website alone...**
      * You can consider other options as well, if this were a real life scenario.
      * **I might talk to a supervisor or talk to somebody else you know has done something like this, or talk to the NSO and find out, hey, what is available? And what they recommend. Because a lot of this could be worked out through speech or through someone who knows more about it and could instantly help you.**
  * What would you be eligible for  
  * What info would you need to apply?

### Things to watch for:

* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Based on what we went through, what did you find most challenging to find? How could it be better?
  * **Probably education benefits, because those pages weren't loading.**
  * What about if the pages loaded, if you can imagine being able to see it
    * **It's realy easy to separate these out visually \(side nav on home loan\) - not just a whole bunch of options in white. Chunks the information into different categories to have your brain sort through them. As well, these have arrows, so you know it's a dropbox, so you can look at that. That might be something for the education side.**
  * Rate the education task 1\(most difficult\) - 5\(easiest\)
    * **Probably a 1. I felt like I was going in circles a little bit. And then technical difficulties, you can't really judge a program on technical difficulties because you don't always know that's going to happen, but that did add to the frustration.**
* Any questions for me?
  * **Nope. I hope I was helpful.**
