## Background Questions - 5 minutes \(:08\)

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

1. Which VA benefits have you used?
   1. **are you specifically talking about VHA or VA in general?**
   2. **I've used VCA, VBA, and VHA, all three.**
   3. **Currently using VA home loan. Have a child buried in a national cemetery. I have used Voc Rehab but not GI Bill. I guess Voc Rehab is not technically an education benefit. My husband used GI Bill, but I never used mine in time. I'm a service connected rated Veteran. Use VA as my primary healthcare facility, and so does my husband. I use it for managing my 2 disabilities that are rated, and I use it for weekend care in the ER if we have to, and I use it for primary care for things like flu shots, annual health exams. I use the women's clinic specifically. husband goes to a regular primary care team. I've used mental health services on my own, and we've used them as a family.**
   4. **First disabililty rating was given to me at discharge, so I didn't have to do anything for that. Second one: I ended up attempting to use a VSO. was convoluted, not easy to do. Ended up finding a woman who worked with a nonprofit, worked on different issues women Veterans have gone through. She was extremely helpful. I went through the power of attorney thing, and she signed the… There was a new thing online - with VBA, you could do something like a quick claim where you had everything packaged together. We had done a lot of work to put everything together really completely, and I had a response in less than 90 days, so that was really great.**
   5. **We've used a couple of different procedures for adding beneficiaries, because we are both disabled Vets. When we had a child, we did it by phone. Process was easy for him, difficult for me. I should have done it as the same time as him, but I didn't. I was trying to add my son at the same time as adding him \(husband\). They asked for so much information. including marriage date, divorce date, SSN of my first husband. I don't have that any more. I went a long time before I could add my husband and my son as beneficiaries because it was so frustrating. Then recently, about 4 months ago, i gave up a day for it. Sat on the phone with a gentleman with VBA. had to do a lot of different steps to get me set up on the internet for benefits. he walked me through the steps, which was incredibly helpful. Finally we got my beneficiaries updated. My son is 3, almost 4 years old. We've been married for 5 years, so that's what it took to get all of that sorted out. I wouldn't say that process was really easy**
   6. **Health benefits - that's become easier. I moved VAs a few times because of moves. Went in person. Didn't even make me bring my DD214 and stuff. They were able to pull my info. Prior to that in another VA, it was trickier. Prior to that, in another VA, it was really complex. So it's gotten easier over the years. That has become more streamlined. Seems you can go in in person, although they're not forwarding all the records - when I go in, they don't have all my podiatry records.**
   7. **Home loan. We went through a new builder. All we had to do was sign paperwork, builder handled the rest.**
   8. **Cemetery - that was amazing. The person I was working with was promoted, very helpful. I was still carrying my daughter at the time. Was dealing with something tricky, had to deal with it ahead of time. The information that is available online or anywhere whether you go into a cemetery - for parents to know about dependent info in a cemetery. It's so brief and so short. If you happen to be a grieving Veteran, who's not at full capacity, or a Veteran with PTSD, it is next to impossible to understand that is a benefit that you even qualify for and how to go about getting it. Majority of Veterans I have met who have had to bury a child - less than 1 out of 50 even know it was an option.**

About finding info on va.gov

1. How often do you come to va.gov?
   1. What do you come to the site for?
   2. Have you:
      1. Applied for disability compensation from VA?
         1. Checked on the status of a disability claim?
      2. Applied for VA healthcare?
         1. Managed prescription refills?
         2. Sent / received secure messages with your healthcare team?
      3. looked up information about treating a medical condition on va.gov?
      4. Sought out home loan benefits?
      5. Sought out education benefits?
2. Tell me about an experience you've had with va.gov
   1. What were you trying to accomplish?
      1. **Trying to find info on cemetery benefits for a child**
      2. **I was completely aware that there was a benefit for it. I was in a civilian cemetery. The person who I was visiting with happened to be a Veteran. He was explaining to me: if you are both honorably discharged, you could go to this cemetery, and you can have her buried for free. We didn't have the money to bury her. We were struggling. We had worked with an outside nonprofit to get us back into housing when we had been through a period of not having housing, so we were not in a position of being able to come up with funeral and burial expenses. They go into the thousands. They say, "oh, when it's a baby, there's a compassion fee", but that's just in the small thousands, not the 10 thousands. It's in the 2s and 3s. I went up there and I met with her. Really nice gal. She really guided through the process. It wasn't until another Veteran told me about the process. Since then, I've worked with a lot of Veterans. As I was going through my process of trying to find support… I'm a PTSD Vet. Because of the loss of my daughter, that triggered my PTSD. I went back to mental health counseling. Can't remember what it's called now, went to a section of the site where you can see connect with other Veterans who are going through similar things. I went in trying to find Veterans who were dealing with grief or who had lost anyone in their family, and there wasn't everything. Absolutely nothing. I went into mental health, went into grief support. There was nothing. All of the grief support that was out there was for those people who had lost a servicemember who had served, or battle buddy who had been lost or returned and committed suicide. Nothing for women Veterans who were dealing with post partum loss. It's a really fast growing need, but it's not there. Only time I went into burials and memorials was to see what they were saying. Probably only 2 sentences about that benefit. It's really not being advertised for folks, which is fine, but it's a traumatic event, and people really need to find out about it. 1 in 3 women lose a pregnancy or a baby in the first 12 months of life. Women Veterans are the fastest growing segment. And those are issues that would affect even a dad who had served. The age group of returning Veterans now are making families. Those kinds of benefits for families to lean on in a time of crisis should not be so difficult to find. Most info is geared toward aging Veterans. Other group is post-911 Veterans - really specific group.**
   2. How did it go trying to do that?
   3. How might it have been better?

## Tasks

\(15:50\)

## Task: Apply for Disability Compensation - 8 minutes \(:16\)

Scenario: Pretend you don't have a disability rating from VA yet, but you have been diagnosed with PTSD, and you'd like to apply for disability compensation. Show where you'd go to submit the application online.

* **For me, I know it's divided into VHA, VBA… I'm going to go to the Benefits section. On facebook, many people don't know it's a separate division. Could be made more cear. Veteran benefits. Compensation. I'm going over here to the gray sidebar. If I were a Veteran doing this for the first time, I'd look for something that says Disability . I don't see anything here that says that. Click on Compensation. Types of Claims… It would be helpful if there one that said "file". Oh, here we go, "Apply". So How to apply. Numerous ways to apply depending on the type of benefit you are seeking. Online using an eBenefits account. Submit. Oh, I see, it's separate bullet points. So Online OR… I didn't quickly distinguish that those were separate ways. an "or" between those lines would be helpful to make it clear that I don't need to do all of those steps in the list. Keep in mind that I'm on medicaiton that makes my brain a little foggy. A lot of PTSD medication does that. I don't want to go into a regional VA. That sounds really hard. Work with an accredited representative or agent - that sounds kind of helpful to have a person. Or go to eBenefits. I'm going to try eBenefits.**
* Probe questions \(as needed\)
  * What would you need to qualify for disability compensation?
    * **Well, claims process would be…. If I were brand new, I might look at claims process to familiarize myself. So this is helpful. We have some steps. That's good. There are 8 distinct steps. The thing is - even though it's only been 3 years since I applied, I'm hearing from the Veteran community that it's different. It's hard to keep up with what it is that we need. I don't feel we have a clear grip on that. If I were trying to figure out what I was going to need, I'd go to this - "claims process". Let's see. That's the claims process once you've sent it. Where do we find… Fully Developed Claims, that's what I did 3 years ago. Where's the section?** 
    * **Ah, Evidence Requirements \(opens sub-menu\). Let's look at that. I actually have a claim for increase pending right now. I personally went into the VA to wrap that up too. Asking how I've done this. Went into Disabled Veterans of America. Trying to up one rating higher since my symptoms are clearly in that range and also trying to add on another area. This looks really confusing to me. First of all. DBQ. There are 10 things listed that start with DBQ. What's that? Disability Benefit Qualifications, I guess? \(clicks link\) Ah, questionnaires. \(reading\). Oh, that's interesting. "Option to visit your private healthcare provider." Oh, I didn't know that. "Veterans can have their providers fill out any of the more than 70 DBQs that are appropriate for their conditions." Oh, wow! I definitely didn't know that. That's really interesting. Okay, so this might be really. This is either new or new since I started doing stuff. Okay, we've got 70 different questionnaires that I can click on. This has piqued my interest. \(scrolling down\). Can we go to the foot and leg area? Or podiatry. Oh, it's not podiatry. Well, I'm not seeing my section. Does this lead me to believe that it's only certain types of… Oh, musculoskeletal - maybe that's where I need to look. Ah, ankle, foot? okay. This is interesting. So far, nothing has been said. I'm thinking for the Veteran, this is going to be an out of pocket expense to do this.** 
    * **\(opened form\) My primary care provider says that she's not able to say something is connected. She says she's not allowed. I think she doesn't know what she's talking about. She's being very unhelpful. Okay, foot conditions. So we just take this to.. "VA will not pay or reimburse any expenses or cost incurred in the process for submitting this form". Okay, but this is still super helpful. It feels like, at least when you hit a wall with a VA doctor. I'm finding it very interesting. For a Veteran, I think it's really good. For me to go in and talk… I have a sprained ankle. I sprained it in April, and I sprained it in March. For me to be seen in less than 2 months, I had to go into the ER so that I could document that my foot gave out. I have a service-connected disability in my foot, so if I sprain my ankle because my foot gives out, I need it documented down the road. Then I sprained it again this month. In the interim, I'm supposed to be going to physical therapy, but I can't right now because I re-sprained it and it's too tender, so it's like I'm holding back and not doing anything because my VA doctor won't move forward and see me again until I get to the next step. So this is a good option that I have as a Veteran because the VA is telling me you're stopped here. Can't do anything until you go to physical therapy and get an MRI after physical therapy and then come see me again. So that's where I'm at with being able to see my doctor. Meanwhile things are still happening. If I can add to my claims process and say that things need to be documented, that helps me. I have a series of things that happen and they're not documented because my VA doctor won't see me. So you need the paper trail to show what's going on. you don't know what's going to be relevant later and what's not, but if you go a month past it happening, it won't be on record.**  
    * **I'm going back to the overview. I like that there's an overview because already I have a ton of questions about this process that I didn't know about. I haven't been on the Facebook page in a couple of months to see what people are talking about, but I do go on facebook pages on a regular basis. What have we got? So, very clear instructions on how to find the form and download it, have your provider complete the form. Save a copy for your records and submit the form to VA. But who at VA? VA is really too broad. Do I submit to my PCP? Records? My claims person? That needs to be elaborated on.**
    * **"VBA Transformation". "DBQs are an important example of… eliminate backlogs". Cool. Increase access to services and benefits and Veteran homelessness. That's great. I've been homeless before. It's suprising what can happen to you when everything looks normal on the outside, and in** _**city**_ **you need to be homeless and have a drug problem before they help you because there are too many.**
    * **Okay, go to FAQ to see what I don't know. Even the claims person I saw at DAV? He didn't give me any instructions either - just keep going and we'll build the case, and check back in with me. You can go outside and still there's no guidance. I don't think Veterans know how to build their claims. Veterans are trying to help each other on the front lines. but that's where we're at the biggest disadvantage. Is there anything saying what VA is looking for in a claim - you need something from this category and that category? That's where I am most fuzzy, especially since it keeps changing.**
    * **Okay, this is mostly about the DBQ form, which is awesome - I mean this is a great tool. I still need something that shows me what VA is expecting as I'm building a claim. Let's go to Evidence requirements. Did we go there yet? can't remember. Okay, discharge or separation papers, service treatment records, medical evidence. Okay, so Fully Developed Claims page is where I would go. my fully developed claim was done by somebody else. I think it was at the beginning of it. Allow faster decisions. all the records… which are obtainable.**
    * **I'm not understanding the difference between a regular claim and a fully developed claim. I know that my FDC went through really fast. Haven't talked to anyone else who had an MST? result in less than 90 days. I feel very fortunate. When it says here submit all records… sounds like everything you would do in a normal claim. Reading: "reopened claim, new claims, secondary claims, special claims". Wow, just hm. At this point right now, I would close it down and be done because it's feeling overwhelming again. I only have a 30% PTSD. I'm not as at a disadvantage as some people. I feel overwhelmed easily. This seems really hard. I see this in some companies, don't know if it's insurance or what. You can go through and say "are you in this category or this category?" and you can check a box and you make forward progress. You go to the next step and say "wow, I've made forward progress." And where you make progress, you can save it if you need to step away. Oh, the \_ kids care website, allows us to save our info and apply. I was able to get them healthcare. My kids were without healthcare for over 10 months. With PTSD, that can be one of the things you encounter, and you have guilt and shame because you aren't able to complete a process. But with that, I was able to navigate it with 2 or 3 sessions sitting down at the computer. I don't necessarily get overwhelmed when I'm talking to a person, so if I could do it in person talking with someone, I could do that too, but if I'm sitting down and I have to compartmentalize information, it's harder for me, so that's where the website gets real tricky. something that would take me to the next step. There's so much good info on the VA website, but you feel like you're going in circles. Kind of like hopping and skipping around on lily pads, there's no forward progress. I think for those of us who are struggling through the process, we need to see that we've made it through another step. need to see that we'll be able to navigate through the process on our own and it's not going to be one more thing where we couldn't navigate or do something. As a Veteran, there's nothing more frustrating than not being able to handle something on your own. When you're in the military, your whole identity is about being able to push through something at any cost, and when you get through the military and you're dealing with the VA, you're bouncing all over the place. It's really a huge ego hit. It's a self-confidence hit. Holy crap, I'm not going to be able to manage the bureaucracy of that. I can't do it. I love that there's this new thing. But now I'd probably shut down the laptop.**
  * What information would you need to apply?
* _\[stop when participant gets to eBenefits or they say they would call someone or go to a VSO\]_

### Things to watch for:

* What is the participant's comprehension of eligibility and information they'd need to apply?
* What challenges does the participant have with navigating to the right place to apply online?

## \(if they haven't done it before\) Task: Check Disability Claim Status - 7 minutes \(:23\)

_\[reset to_ [https://www.va.gov/](https://www.va.gov/)_\]_

Scenario: Pretend you have submitted your disability compensation application, a few weeks go by, and you want to check on the status of your claim. Show us how you'd accomplish that.

* _\[stop when participant gets to eBenefits\]_

### Things to watch for:

* Is the participant looking for a way to check claim status on va.gov?

## Task: Applying for healthcare - 7 minutes \(:30\)

Scenario: Think back to recently after you were discharged. You want to apply for health benefits through VA. Show us how you would go about that.

1. **Oh my god. I was discharged in 1994. Had to go to \_ Army Hospital for a whole day to see a doctor at an appointment that I was never seen before. Was told at the end of the day, come back tomorrow. Sat half a day and finally got to see somebody. Don't know what that was all about - is that normal for people? I heard that was normal for people, but I think we're in a different era now.**
2. **Back to homepage - clicks on logo "find the big logo".**
3. **\(reading list of links under Health Care in the bottom-left\)"Access your health benefits". Or get started, I guess. I'm going to do this \(Clicked "access your health benefits"\). Hopefully they'll streamline me.**
4. **"Healthcare applications". Okay. \(reading\) "if you served in the active military… separated under any condition other than dishonorable, you may qualify for VA health care benefits. Learn more." There was actually \(pause\) okay, I'll go here \(learn more button\). In the top of the screen \(carousel\) it also says "healthcare applications - learn more". But I'll go ahead and do this one. Guess they're both taking me to the same spot**
5. **Easy ways to apply for enrollment. \(reading paragraphs\). Can applyl by phone… okay. Where's the phone number? Yeah, there are a lot of VA phone numbers. You don't want to call the wrong one and sit on the phone all day for the wrong one.**
6. **\(reading\) "when Veterans choose to enroll, VA offers… 'Welcome to VA' " so "welcome to VA" is obviously a thing. \(reading more\). "sends introductory letter, personalized handbook". Here where it says more info about the Veterans Health Benefits Handbook - I would think it's the process of becoming a new enrollee, but it's not. It just describes the benefits in a broad - down to specific way. I think I would say in describing the Veterans Health Benefits Handbook, if you know what that is and you've collected a series of them over the years, then you don't need any info like that. But when you're new to the whole VA system, I think there needs to be something that's a little bit more explanatory - think from the perspective of a new Veteran and explain "there's a handbook that can explain more about the benefits that you can get for free here" and say what it is. Here, it's under the heading of "Easy Ways to Apply for Enrollment". It's really not part of enrollment. It's just describing healthcare. I think that confuses the situation by putting it under that heading and by assuming that people know what the Veterans Health Benefits Handbook is. And also further, the Veterans Health Benefits Handbook is special enough to say a little something about. It deserves its own little heading. That thing really helps people to go through and highlight, go through at their own pace, and find things under categories. Visually, for those of us who have a hard time navigating things, that's really helpful.**
7. **We'll still have to scroll down because I'm still not seeing the link to apply. Let's see, so we got a "by telephone" - that's great. "Apply online", "if you need help", "required signature". See again, I feel like right here, you could almost make it seem like - you know how you have a highlighted link, you could have "apply online" and a button. Those of us who aren't going to read through every single line, we could see "apply online", a bunch of info, and a click button to see "I can get to this next step". It is a lot of text. Left column is ways you can apply. right column is a whole bunch of other information that I'm sure is helpful, however, it's not separated really in any kind of a way. If I were having a hard day, this wouldn't be easy for me to navigate, and I'm smart. So I think that we need maybe. I think people are using a lot of things where there's a button to click navigation. I feel it streamlines it. I feel like the information is optional. If you have six bullet points under "Apply online", that info is there for people who want more info, but not everybody wants it. Some people see "apply online" and a button, and they're two-step people - "apply online" and "click". Right now, you're servicing the person who says "I want all the info", and that's what the page is - "holy crap, it's a lot of information", and it's awesome except that in this case I'm not sure it's laid out very user friendly. Left column is all the ways to apply. Right column is other info, and I'm not sure that that's really distinguishing it, but I don't think it's user friendly for those of us who struggle with getting through this process.**

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

* Based on what we went through, what did you find most challenging to find? 
  * **healthcare.**
  * Rate it 1\(most difficult\) to 5\(easiest\)
    * **3.** 
    * **I think your Veteran who comes out without any issues or struggles - this might not be very difficult for them, but that's not the demographic that the VA serves.**
  * How could it be better?
    * **step by step process**
    * **We have a lot of Veterans who are overwhelmed with the process. I think what VA is trying to do \(and I appreciate it on so many levels\) is to better communicate all the information, but I think what you have is a lot of people who are at a good spot career-wise who are building tools looking at them from a perspective of a person who is high-functioning and career-stable and able to navigate things. And I don't think that's a lot of us who are struggling in the VA. I don't think that's who a lot of us are, and I think that's a real problem.**
    * **I don't think you want to make it look like you're talking to a bunch of dummies, because we're people who went through extraordinary circumstances to serve our country, and we don't want to be treated like we're a bunch of idiots, but at the same time, it is so disheartening and so hard on us to feel like we can't navigate this stuff. So there needs to be more focus turned to \(you'd better be careful talking about things in meeting rooms in case someone who records it so you don't get caught like those NFL guys\). We're talking about people who have dealt with trauma, and trauma re-wires the brain and makes it difficult to function. when you put on top of that that a lot of us are on medications, even pain meds. I've had chronic pain for over 20 years now, walk on a curved bone in my foot now, and it's very painful, have lockjaw, and I'm stressed and tense. Your attention span, way of navigating, ability to get through these things is not the same as a person who has gone through college and is really great at building amazing IT platforms.**
    * **I think what you're doing now with asking for Veteran input is phenomenal. I'm so happy that you're doing it. That's why when you asked me, I was on board in a second because if I can represent a Veteran voice who gets foggy sometimes and has difficulty, then that's a voice that you're hearing. I think more of that. More testing of what you're doing with real Veterans is important, and I think that you should think of those of us who are smart and capable and have done amazing things, but at the same time, there is so much information, and we need to make forward momentum - we need to be able to get through it. we can see there's steps 1-10 and we're at 3 out of 10 and see that our progress is saved and you can re-log in later.**
    * **Thank you for trying so hard, for taking steps to get our feedback on this, because this is solveable. There are a lot of super smart folks on your end, and the feedback of what's not working for Veterans and what will - I think there's solutions right around the corner on this, really. So this is achievable. Get back to work.**
* Any questions for me?
