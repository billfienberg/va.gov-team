**Session Report**

[Github Issue 10197](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/10197)

## Participant Description

Describe the participant in a few sentences, including their role within the system, why we’ve chosen them for a feedback session and relevant demographic information.

## Key Findings

1. ​The left nav contains all benefit options so when she clicked into Education from the home page she assumed all left options were part of education and training \(i.e. compensation was education compensation\)
2. too many options within Voc Rehab to go through in the nav, overwhelming, she want priority items at top and then additional content nested on those.  
3. Same sentiment under Education area, wanted help/guidance on where to start, what I don't know if I want...I would have to look in each
4. In the end she talked about feeling like going in circles...this echoes the sentiment that others have had about not feeling like they are making forward progress.
5. thought VA should already have her info re: home loan if she were an active service member
6. wanted a step by step set of questions to avoid going down a dead end
