## Participant Description

Describe the participant in a few sentences, including their role within the system, why we’ve chosen them for a feedback session and relevant demographic information.

## Key Findings

1. ​She really had a lot to say, and all of it was really quite powerful. There are so many quotes in this interview and so many great nuggets. 
2. She really hit home on the sense of forward progress and how she wasn't getting that from this site. She used the analogy of "hopping and skipping around on lilly pads...but no feeling of forward progress"  
3. She wanted content that was very clear on what to do and how to do it. This again relates to the first point where she just wasn't finding a clear path forward
4. she used the bottom of the home page where options are in groups by administration and then mentioned that she's familiar with this division but didn't feel most veterans understood that. 
5. "Compensation" was not entirely clear enough for her although she did navigate there to find disability ino
6. She had great feedback on how dependent benefits, specifically in burials and memorials, is not visible...she said "Non-existent"
7. she made reference to Voc Rehab not technically being an education benefit...I'm making this note more for myself, as this is such a fuzzy area
8. she spoke a lot about PTSD and overwhelmed Veterans and how the information available is comprehensive but not easy - what is there is not geared towards those that are struggling in the VA, and she feels that is more than the case than those that are not struggling.  She defines them as smart and capable but need forward momentum, don't talk down to them but don't overwhelm.
