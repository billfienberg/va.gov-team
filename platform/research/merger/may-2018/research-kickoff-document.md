# Research Kickoff Document

**Directions:** UX lead seeking research should fill out this template and schedule a meeting with the PM, researcher, and recruiter to discuss. All parties must assent to this information before recruitment can begin.

## Purpose

Gather baseline data for va.gov. Illustrate what the experience is like before merger happens, so that we can point to this evidence if needed, should any stakeholders question the necessity to do the merger work in the future.

What we want to study: the experience of users starting on va.gov homepage, not other entry points. We're not measuring experiences on MHV, eBenefits, etc. Stop when they exit va.gov.

\(these are supported by analytics data from va.gov\) Measure the most important tasks:

1. applying for healthcare \(1010-EZ\)
   1. prescription refills
   2. secure messaging
   3. Healthcare information - seeking info about a particular diagnosis on va.gov
2. applying for disability \(526\)
   1. checking claim status \(mostly disability\)
3. home loan certificate of eligibility
4. education benefits application \(1990\).

### Other research work to know about

Past vets.gov studies on various teams \(determined none is applicable to this\).

\[Foresee survey data from April 2018\]\([https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/merger/apr-2018/april-2018-va-main-\(002\)-kp-notes.pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/merger/apr-2018/april-2018-va-main-%28002%29-kp-notes.pdf)\)

Merger team will combine this qualitative data with satisfaction metrics later.

## Type of Research \([examples](https://methods.18f.gov/)\)

Remote, moderated usability testing

## Recruitment criteria

* Number of participants: 6-8
* Participant Requirements
  * some Veterans, but would be nice if possible \(not required\) to also get some people from the following groups:
    * Veterans' spouses
    * Veterans' children 
    * Veterans' caregivers 
    * VSO coordinators
  * No VA employees
  * Good to know if they're current MHV or eBenefits users, but not a requirement for recruiting
* _Indicate if you're looking for a particular age range, geographic reach, account type, or other demographics. In our recruitment, we strive to include a mix of participants that is representative of the_ [_demographics of the US Veteran population_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/veteran-population-demographics.md)_._ 

## Dates and Times You Would Like to Have Sessions

Not particular about timing to have this complete, since this is just informing baseline. And we can shift this as needed since there are no dependencies on deliverables that don't exist yet. Ideally let's do it before Mike gets busy with Griffins research like next round of Login.

**5/7-5/9 \(preferred\) and week of 5/14 \(if needed\)**

* Mike's availability: check calendar. Can schedule sessions 9-7 M-F. Okay to schedule over anything that's not listed as PTO, commuting, appointment, or another session
