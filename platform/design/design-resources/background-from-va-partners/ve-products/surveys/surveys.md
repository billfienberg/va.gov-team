The National Cemetery Administration has participated in the American Customer Satisfaction Index Survey \(ACSI\) since 2001 and every three years after that up until now 2016. The ACSI is the national indicator of customer evaluations of the quality of goods and services available to U.S. Residents and is the only uniform cross-industry/government measure of customer satisfaction. The VA Inter Agency memo above provides guidance to VA entities in acquiring the contracted services. The National Cemetery Administration acquired the IA through the Department of Interior’s Federal Consulting Group \(FCG\) who is the sponsor and has the ACSI administered by the Claes Fornell International Group \(CFI\). The purpose of the survey is to assess the quality of services and products and to determine or identify key areas for improvement.

The National Cemetery Administration also contracts independent contractors to conduct the National Cemetery Satisfaction Survey \(CSS\)of Next of Kin or individuals who have interred a loved one in a national, state or tribal cemetery regarding the quality of services and goods.

The aspects of the customer experienced that are measured in the ACSI as well as the National Cemetery CSS focus on key drivers of customer satisfaction: Customer Service, Expectations, Information about NCA and Cemetery Services. To accomplish this through the ACSI survey above you will find the 14 questions that were provided to the Next of Kin or individuals who interred a loved one in a national cemetery for the ACSI survey.

It is important to mentioned that, for 2016 the ACSI survey was distributed to Next of Kin or individuals who interred a loved in a national cemetery during the period of March 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and excludes NOK or individuals responsible for interment of a loved in a VA National Cemetery already surveyed in NCA’s CSS. Also, the ACSI survey is only distributed to NOK and/or individuals who had interred a loved in a national cemetery, whereas the National Cemetery CSS is provided to NOK from National Cemetery, State Veterans Cemetery, Tribal Cemeteries and Funeral Directors.
