# Manual Functional Testing

## Recommendations

1. Based on your product's development and logistics, it may be possible to begin conducting manual verifications of acceptance criteria mid-sprint.
2. Conduct a final round of manual verification when your team closes out the sprint.

## What you'll need

* Use TestRail to craft your test plan.
* Provide traceability by using TestRail's **References** field to link to a related user story for each test case.
* Use TestRail's **Defects** field to link issues discovered during testing to the test case execution that uncovered the issue.
