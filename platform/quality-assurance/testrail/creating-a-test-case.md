# Creating a test case in TestRail

1. Verify that you are logged into the [DSVA VSP TestRail instance](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/).  
2. Navigate to your project by selecting it from the Dashboard.  
3. Click _Add_ from the _Actions_ panel on the right side of the screen.

4. Enter a _Title_ for your test case that describes the user story that is being verified as well as the expected outcome -- for example, "Verify that an authenticated va.gov user is presented a "My Profile" link".  
5. By default, the "Test Case\(Text\)" template will be selected.  This allows the author to enter test case steps into a single free text field.

   _You may prefer to use the "Test Case\(Steps\)" template which allows the author to enter test steps and the expected outcome for each step into discrete text boxes._

6. In order to improve searchability and the ease with which you may incorporate test cases into test plans be sure to fill out all of the fields with accurate data.
